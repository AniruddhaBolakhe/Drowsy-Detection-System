VGG16 and VGG19:

Pros: Simple and widely used, good for transfer learning.
Cons: Computationally expensive and memory-intensive due to a large number of parameters.
Suitability: Good for high-accuracy applications where computational resources are not a limitation.

ResNet (e.g., ResNet50):

Pros: Solves the vanishing gradient problem with skip connections, high accuracy.
Cons: More complex than VGG, still relatively heavy computationally.
Suitability: Good balance of performance and accuracy, suitable for slightly resource-constrained environments.

Inception (e.g., InceptionV3):

Pros: Efficient and deep, incorporates multi-scale processing.
Cons: More complex architecture.
Suitability: Suitable for applications requiring high accuracy with relatively efficient computation.

MobileNet:

Pros: Designed for mobile and embedded vision applications, very efficient.
Cons: May have slightly lower accuracy compared to deeper models like ResNet or Inception.
Suitability: Ideal for real-time applications on mobile devices or edge computing environments.

EfficientNet:

Pros: Balances accuracy and efficiency using a compound scaling method, state-of-the-art performance.
Cons: Can be complex to train from scratch.
Suitability: Excellent for applications needing a balance of high accuracy and efficiency.
